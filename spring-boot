Setup multi branch pipeline for a simple github repository that builds diff branches independently for a java-springboot based github project

step1:Install jenkins and plugins
	- install the multibranch plugin.
	- install github plugin.
	- install maven plugin.
	
step2: create repository.
	- create a github repository for source code.
	- required valid pom.xml file for build.
	
step3:configure multibranch pipeline in jenkins.
  - login to jenkins.
  - create a new multi branch pipeline
     newitem---> multibranch pipeline -->give a name --> ok
  - set up source code management
    - add git hub 
      - provide github URL.
      - Add credentials.
      - set the branch discovery strategy
      - configure build triggers
        add webhook in jenkins which automatically detects the changes from github 0r build periodically by scheduling the cront job.
  step4: jenkins file
        creating jenkins file

  step5: verifying pipeline
    - Commit changes to different branches in the repository.
    - Jenkins should automatically detect the branches and build them independently.
    - Check the console logs to verify the build process.
